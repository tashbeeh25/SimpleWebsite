    <h2><mark>Student Ambassador October 2017 - Present</mark></h2>
    <p><mark>I have been working on campus as a student ambassador since October. As a student ambassador, I represent the University of
	Essex and support the Communications and External Relations Section, predominately
	through the Student Recruitment and Education Outreach Teams.post of Student Ambassador provides varied duties offering the opportunity for personal
	development, to gain a range of skills and the possibility to undertake further responsibility.
	Student Ambassador work will count towards the University’s Big Essex Award, designed to
	accredit extra-curricular activity and employability skills. The Award will aid students in
	identifying the skills developed through the Student Ambassador post and articulate these to
	future employers</mark></p>
	<h2><mark>Peer Mentor October 2017 - Present</mark></h2>
	<p><mark>I am also a peer mentor for the year. Mentoring is a relationship usually between a new student (the mentee) 
	and a more experienced student (the mentor) to help the new student settle in, and to make them aware of ways 
	that they can get involved and make the most of their university experience.</mark><p>

	<h2><mark>Course Representative October 2015 - Present</mark></h2>
	<p><mark> I have also been a course rep since last year. 
	A Course Rep is an ordinary student, that volunteers their time to support students on their course, 
	shape their degree around what students need, and feed back to the Students Union to help them to keep their 
	number one promise to students – to help you get an amazing degree and job!</mark><p>
