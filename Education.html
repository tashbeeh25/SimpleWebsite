	<p><mark>First year team project: Taking the role of project manager, I had to play different roles. 
	Some important roles were to keep minutes and agendas of our team meeting. 
	I had to handle the project management section of the project where I had to make Gantt Charts 
	and make many flow charts and diagrams for my team and be organised to guide my team. The role helped me 
	to develop various skills such as communication, organisation and cooperation</mark><p>

	<p><mark>Peer Helper: In my final year of school I had to guide new student who had just starting off at the school.
